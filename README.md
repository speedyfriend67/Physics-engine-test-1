# Colliding Engines with Customizable Settings

This HTML code provides a visual simulation of colliding engines with customizable settings, including gravity strength, particle count, and velocity range.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Click the "Toggle Debug" button to customize settings and view additional details about the particles.
3. Adjust gravity strength, particle count, and velocity range as desired.
4. Enjoy the simulation!

## Customizable Settings

- **Gravity Strength:** Adjust the strength of gravity.
- **Particle Count:** Set the number of particles in the simulation.
- **Velocity Range:** Define the range of particle velocities.

## Debug Mode

- When debug mode is toggled, additional information such as particle direction, X velocity, and Y velocity is displayed.
- Click the "Toggle Debug" button to enter custom settings during debug mode.
